# Fill out the following information which will be used for GBS analysis.
# Please ONLY make changes after an equals sign (=).
# Do not add any other text to the file, and do not remove any existing text.
# Do NOT include whitespace, instead use underscore: '_'
# Include the full pathname to files, directories and programs if they exist
#   outside of the current working directory (do NOT use '~' for home directory)

# Example: LC-01
POPULATION =

# The filename of indices (aka barcodes) used for this GBS run.
# This file can be in one of 2 formats. Either:
#   1) A single column list of indices
#   2) 2 columns where the first column consists of sample names, and the second column
#      of the sample's associated index
# Example: indices.txt

# Example: /storage/lens_GBS/processed_reads

# Example: ../NC_008253.fna

### DEMULTIPLEX - STEP 1 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ###
##################################################

# The rare-cutter restriction enzyme site. This is only necessary if the sequences of the
# indices include the RE site (to prevent the RE site from being clipped from the reads).
# If the RE site is not attached to your indices, leave this blank.
# Example: TGCA

# Hint: If you do not have a list of adaptor sequences, Trimmomatic provides multiple lists
# of sequences in the adaptors folder in your Trimmomatic directory
# Example: trimfile.txt

  # DEFAULT: 1
  TRIM_THREADS =
  # The maximum mismatch count to allow a full match
  # DEFAULT: 2
  SEED_MISMATCHES =
  # Specifies accuracy needed for a match between two adapter ligated reads
  # DEFAULT: 30
  PALINDROME_CLIP_THRESHOLD =
  # Specifies accuracy needed for a match between any adapter and read
  # DEFAULT: 20
  SIMPLE_CLIP_THRESHOLD =
  # The number of bases to average across in sliding window trimming
  # DEFAULT: 4
  WINDOW_SIZE =
  # The average quality required in a sliding window trimming procedure
  # DEFAULT : 15

  # Threshold for minimum quality of leading bases
  # DEFAULT: 3

### ALIGN - STEP 3 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ###

# The relative or full pathname to your compiled copy of bowtie2
# Example: ../Tools/bowtie2-2.2.3
BOWTIE2_PATH =

### BOWTIE2 OPTIONS - Refer to Bowtie2 manual ###
### Note: These defaults are GBS-specific and NOT the defaults set out by Bowtie2  ###
  # The number of threads to use on an HPC cluster
  # DEFAULT: 1
  ALIGN_THREADS =
  # The number of maximum valid alignments for each read to be made
  # Note: the pipeline will choose the best hit so at least 2 is recommended
  # DEFAULT: 3
  MAX_VALID_ALIGNMENTS =
  # The maximum fragment length for valid paired-end alignments
  # DEFAULT: 11000

# The mode for sample variant calling. Choose one of:
## - single: variants are called for each sample individually against the reference genome
## - multi: variants are called for all samples at once against the reference genome
## - both
