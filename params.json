{"name":"GBS Pipeline","tagline":"A complete set of commands to demultiplex, trim, align and call raw variants on paired-end reads for the purpose of analyzing reads generated by genotyping by sequencing (GBS).","body":"# Prerequisites\r\n\r\nBefore using the GBSpipeline, you will need to install the following programs. I recommend creating a directory specifically for running the pipeline and placing the programs in there as this makes it very easy to provide the pipeline with the location of your programs. If you prefer, like me, to have a separate directory for programs (mine is called \"Tools\"), you can download the source/binary files there and compile as necessary, and provide the pathnames to each program. \r\n\r\n### 1. trimmomatic\r\n\r\nDownload link: [http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)\r\n\r\nI recommend downloading the binary as there is no compiling from source code; just simply place the \"trimmomatic-[version].jar file into the directory of your choice. It is also worth reading up on trimmomatic on how it trims paired-end reads, especially the options you can provide it, as you can use it to tweak the default options in the pipeline.\r\n\r\n### 2. bowtie2\r\n\r\nDownload link: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/2.2.3/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/2.2.3/)\r\n\r\nEnsure you choose the right binary for your operating system (either Linux or MacOS) and again, simply place the folder into your desired directory. If you would rather compile from source, the instructions are in the bowtie2 manual at: [http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml). This is also where you'll find the various options when running bowtie2, which can also be passed into the pipeline.\r\n\r\n### 3. SAMtools\r\n\r\nDownload link: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/0.1.19/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/0.1.19/)\r\n\r\nNote: SAMtools has just graduated to a full 1.0 version; however, you will still need to use version 0.1.19 for this pipeline to work. This version comes packaged with bcftools which is also necessary for the pipeline. \r\n\r\nSAMtools needs to be compiled; so open up a terminal window and enter the SAMtools directory in the location you've placed it and type 'make' from the command line:\r\n\r\n`cd samtools-0.1.19`  \r\n`make`\r\n\r\nYou should see some output telling you that it compiled successfully (hopefully!). For a great tutorial on how to use SAMtools (though it won't be necessary to use this pipeline, but it is a great package for handling copious amounts of sequence data), I highly recommend this tutorial: [http://biobits.org/samtools_primer.html](http://biobits.org/samtools_primer.html)\r\n\r\n# Download\r\n\r\nNow you are ready to download the GBS Pipeline. To ensure you have the latest version, use the following git command to download it directly from github:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/carolyncaron/GBSpipeline.git`\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you don't have git installed, you can download the zip file on this site and place it into the directory of your choice as with the previous dependencies. Once you have the GBS pipeline in its own directory, it is time to copy the required files to the same directory. Again, if you choose not to copy all of these files (for memory-saving reasons), just remember to use the pathname for each as parameters when using the pipeline.\r\nThe following files are required:\r\n* A barcode file - This should be provided by Illumina as a list of short nucleotide sequences. Each sample was given a \"barcode\" to distinguish its sequences from other samples, thus each sequence begins with a barcode.\r\n* Two FASTQ files containing paired-end read data - also provided by Illumina, their version needs to be 1.8 or higher. Each read in the first file is paired with a read in the second file. Only the first set of reads contain the barcodes, so it is important to list this file before the second file when telling the pipeline where to find the reads. \r\n* A trim file - A FASTA file of adaptors that trimmomatic will use to trim from the reads. This is likely also provided by Illumina. Your download of trimmomatic will also include various files that you can use as your trim file (see the [manual page](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) for Trimmomatic).\r\n* A reference genome in FASTA format\r\n* Reference genome index files (optional). These should have the same name as the reference genome but with suffixes such as 1.bt2, 2.bt2 and so on. The pipeline will look for these in the same directory as the reference genome, but if they are not present, the pipeline will create them. \r\n\r\n# Approach\r\n\r\nThis pipeline is broken up into 4 steps: this allows the user to pause and look over the output before proceeding to the next step. As each step is very time consuming, this also lowers the risk of losing most or all of the progress made up until that point. Each step-specific function prints to the console as to its progress, and creates output files as well as a summary file within the current directory. To call each step and provide it with the necessary parameters and files, you will need to execute the main script in the form:  \r\n`./GBS_pipeline.pl step [arguments] [options]`  \r\nThe following lists examples to demonstrate how to run each step in sequential order. For full documentation on options and output files, type the following on the command line:\r\n`perldoc GBS_pipeline.pl`  \r\n\r\n1. The first step is to demultiplex the reads into separate files for each sample. For example, suppose we are doing a run with Medicago samples:  \r\n`./GBS_pipeline.pl demultiplex Medicago barcodes.list TGCA Mt4.0_read1.fastq Mt4.0_read2.fastq`  \r\nYou should see printed to the console something like (give it some time to complete!):  \r\n`Calling demultiplex …`  \r\n`Demultiplexed barcode CTCCTGCA [1/3]`  \r\n`Demultiplexed barcode TGCATGCA [2/3]`  \r\n`Demultiplexed barcode ACTATGCA [3/3]`  \r\n`Placing reads without an barcode into a separate file…`   \r\n`R1 reads without an index placed in unindexed_Medicago_R1.fastq`  \r\n`R2 reads without an index placed in unindexed_Medicago_R2.fastq`  \r\n`Completed demultiplex.`  \r\n\r\n2. When the first step has completed, next we trim the files for quality and adaptor sequences. Continuing with our example:  \r\n`./GBS_pipeline.pl trim_reads Trimmomatic-0.32/trimmomatic-0.32.jar trimlist.fa`  \r\nAnd the following is printed to the console:  \r\n`Calling trim_reads …`  \r\n`Trimmomatic successfully finished trimming CTCCTGCA indexed reads.`  \r\n`Trimmomatic successfully finished trimming TGCATGCA indexed reads.`  \r\n`Trimmomatic successfully finished trimming ACTATGCA indexed reads.`  \r\n`Completed trim_reads.`  \r\n\r\n3. This step aligns the reads to the reference genome, and is most likely to take the longest time to complete:  \r\n`./GBS_pipeline.pl align_reads ../../Tools/bowtie2-2.2.1 ../Mt4.0_reference.fna`  \r\nWith the following output:  \r\n`Calling align_reads …`  \r\n`Reference genome index files present, proceeding to make alignments.`  \r\n`Running bowtie2 with the following parameters: `  \r\n`\t--end-to-end --no-mixed --no-discordant --no-sq --no-hd -k 1 -X 11000 -R 5 -p 4`  \r\n`Completed alignments for index CTCCTGCA`  \r\n`Completed alignments for index TGCATGCA`  \r\n`Completed alignments for index ACTATGCA`  \r\n`Completed align_reads.`  \r\n\r\n4. The final step is making variant calls using the alignment:  \r\n`./GBS_pipeline.pl SNP_calling ../../Tools/samtools-0.1.19/`  \r\nWith output such as:  \r\n`Calling SNP_calling …`  \r\n`Index CTCCTGCA files converted from .sam to .bam`  \r\n`Completed variant calls for index CTCCTGCA`  \r\n`Index TGCATGCA files converted from .sam to .bam`  \r\n`Completed variant calls for index TGCATGCA`  \r\n`Index ACTATGCA files converted from .sam to .bam`  \r\n`Completed variant calls for index ACTATGCA`  \r\n`Completed SNP_calling.`\r\n\r\nThat's it! Take a look at your directory using the command `ls`. You should see your output files from each step (indexed reads, trimmed reads, alignments, and vcf files) neatly organized into directories called `demultiplex/ trim/ align/ variants/`, respectively.  Additionally, you should see all of your summary files, which can be opened in a plain text editor or in Excel. \r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\nTo access the full documentation for the pipeline, go to: <https://github.com/carolyncaron/GBSpipeline/wiki/GBS-pipeline-POD>\r\n\r\nThe POD can also be accessed on the command line by running: `perldoc GBS_pipeline.pl`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
